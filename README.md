## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With constant practice we get better. I saw this while coding this challenge, although the codes might not be clean but we learn and get better through practice. Learnt the power of gradient and it's effect to designs.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.box-one {
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(252, 100%, 67%), hsl(241, 81%, 54%))
}
.number-circle {
  background: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1), hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0))
}
```


### Continued development

I used flexbox for this particular project and with more learning i hope to get farmilar with Grids which i think will make layouts much more easier to code. Currently learning Javascript inorder to be able to build other projects using JavaScript along side HTML and CSS.
